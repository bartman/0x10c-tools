# About

So far, this project has a working assembler for Notch's new DCPU-16 processor.

I intend to work on a VM next.

# Assembler

Because lua lacks a builtin facility for generating binaries, I am currently
generating text output.

        ./0x10c.lua -a sample.asm -o -

sample.asm is a file obtained from the DCPU-16 documentation.  It is used to 
verify that the code generated by this tool is correct.
