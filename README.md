# About

This is my attempt at DCPU-16 assembler, disassembler, and emulator.

The implementation is a mix of lua and C.

# Assembler

Here is how one could assemble a program:

        $ lua/dcpu-asm examples/sample.dasm
        output going to sample.out

        $ hexdump sample.out
        0000000 7c01 0030 7de1 1000 0020 7803 1000 c00d
        0000010 7dc1 001a a861 7c01 2000 2161 2000 8463
        0000020 806d 7dc1 000d 9031 7c01 0018 7dc1 001a
        0000030 9037 61c1 7dc1 001a                    

sample.asm is a file obtained from the DCPU-16 documentation.  It is used to 
verify that the code generated by this tool is correct.
